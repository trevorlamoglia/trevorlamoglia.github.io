            <p>The Adidas display Visual Hierarchy <br> 
                such as size and scale of an image <br>
                are visually appealing and catches <br>
                the eye easily when the website is <br>
                opened. Not gonna lie, with how <br>
                their Visual Hierarchy is designed, <br>
                I would probably buy a pair of shoes. <br>
                Might've done it once already.

            <p>Not many people know about Lyrical <br>
                Lemonade. Check it out if you haven't. <br>
                Lyrical Lemonade has a clean design <br>
                that makes it less confusing to the eye <br>
                and is visually appealing. The white space <br>
                here is great as it balances the design <br>
                elements adn better organize content to <br>
                visual experience.

            <p>Twitch has a great design in using <br>
                Proximity. It separates the design <br>
                depending on what the user views. <br>
                The proximity that is designed <br>
                create organization, structure, and <br>
                relevancy. The content as well <br>
                changes as the user alters from <br>
                their usual views.
