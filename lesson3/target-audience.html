            Scenario 1:
        </h3>
        <p>
            A couple college students wants to go hiking.
            They want to know what the weather will be like
            to see when would be the best time to go. This
            website will provide the information of when the
            best time would be.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Scenario 2:
        </h3>
        <p>
            An adventurer. Traveling, going on a road trip.
            She would want to check this website to see if
            she should go out on an adventurer and go for a
            drive or if she should stay in the house and do
            it another day.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Scenario 3:
        </h3>
        <p>
            A college student would check this website
            to see which outfit she would choose for the
            day. Yeah, she's one of those college girls
            who wants and needs to look cute for boys.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Scenario 4:
        </h3>
        <p>
            A young adult, thinking of going on a sledding
            date. He would check this website to see how
            cold it would be outside and see if his date
            is still down to go on this date and if she
            would enjoy the freezing temperature. Or maybe
            they can just get hot cocoa and keep themselves
            warm.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Scenario 5:
        </h3>
        <p>
            A group of friends wanting to play some outdoor
            basketball would want to check this website and
            see how hot it would be outside. They will not 
            only see the temperature but also see how humid
            it would be outside. They might reconsider playing
            basketball indoors then.
